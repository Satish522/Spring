1-> org.hibernate.HibernateException: identifier of an instance of members.Appointment was altered from 8 to 8 

Solution:- The problem was that the idAppointment member variable in the Java class and the idappointment field 
in the MySQL database table were of the type int. So why the hell did I have the type short in the mapping? 
The answer is simple: because of the copy paste. So the correct code is:

<id name="idAppointment" column="idappointment">
<generator class="native"/>
</id>
Conclusion: copy paste is sometimes evil.
